# Vectorization (Term Frequency and Document Frequency)
### Introduction:
Vectorization is an essential step in data cleaning or to understand the data. <br />
This notebook is one of my assignment in a course. It will go through all the text files and count:
<ul>
<li>Term Frequency: Number of times each word exist in that file</li>
<li>Document Frequency: Number of documents in the folder that the word exists</li>
</ul>
