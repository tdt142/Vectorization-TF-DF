# Vectorization (Term Frequency and Document Frequency)
### Introduction:
Vectorization is an essential step in data cleaning or to understand the data. <br />
There are notebook and Python files in this repository for your preference <br />
This notebook is one of my assignment in a course. It will go through all the text files and count:
<ul>
<li>Term Frequency: Number of times each word exist in that file</li>
<li>Document Frequency: Number of documents in the folder that the word exists</li>
</ul>

### Instruction:
<ul>
  <li>Put the text files in Files folder.</li>
  <li>Name the text files as x.txt, where x is number. All files should be named in subsequence order (ex: first file should be 1.txt, second is 2.txt, etc) </li>
  <li>Use files in Result folder to check the result. For term frequencies, it is named corresponding with the text files (ex: term frequency result of 1.txt is tf_1.txt) </li>
</ul
