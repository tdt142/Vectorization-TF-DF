To be honest, I was terrified of writing before I join the university, as an international 
student, writing academically in another language is such a nightmare. In addition to that, when I 
hear you say about the project on the very first day, I felt such overwhelming because of its 
volume. With that being said, I have no idea with what I am writing about to ensure the 
academical purposes, and to fit in all ten different chapters. Because I scare of writing, I did not 
start my first milestone until some days before the due dates. I research some popular, concerned 
topic across the IT field to see if there are anything that I would interest in to write about. My 
major in Information Systems and I am excessively interested in having a career in data fields 
such as data analytics, data communication, database. So cloud pops up in my head, an area that 
carries tons of data every day across its network.
